# Atom Animations

Atom Animations is a project done for the Computer Science and Chemistry departments of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo to provide 3D visualizations of the various stages the models of the atom has gone through throughout history. It was programmed entirely by myself. Move the camera's angle with 'WASD' and its location with the arrow keys.

## Tech
AtomAnimations was programmed in [Processing](Processing.org).

## Downloads
Processing 3 is giving me a hard time when it comes to creating executables. For now, you can run the source in the [Processing](Processing.org) IDE.
